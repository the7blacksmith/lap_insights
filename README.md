# lap insights ⏱️
lap insights is a long-term project that provides rental kart drivers with graphical insights to analyze their races.

Currently, as lap insights evolve, users will need to upload a CSV file containing their lap times in the Henakart circuit, in Madrid, Spain. The system will then generate different graphs and charts for users to explore.

The ultimate goal is to have access to lap times from the most important circuits in Spain without users needing to upload the CSV files.
